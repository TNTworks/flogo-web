# Models

This documents details the structure of the internal models in the Flogo Web UI and the differences when compared to the [Flogo core app model](https://github.com/project-flogo/core/blob/master/docs/model.md).

The import and export process makes sure that a standard Flogo App Model can be converted into the internal Flogo Web app model and viceversa.
